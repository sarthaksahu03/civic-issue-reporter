# Public-Grievance-Reporter
Public Grievance Reporter is a real-time civic engagement platform that enables citizens to report local issues (e.g., potholes, streetlight outages, sanitation problems) and track their resolution progress. The system facilitates transparency between the public and administration through instant updates, live notifications, and dashboard.
